vocabulary given in the end of the book.}\par
Within customer premises the importance of the cabling infrastracture is similar to that of other
fundamental building utilities such as heating, lighting and mains power. As with other utilities,
interruptions to service can have serious impact. Poor quality of service due to lack of design foresight,
use of inappropriate components, incorrect installation, poor administration or inadequate support can
threaten an organization's effectiveness.\par
Historically, the cabling within a premises comprised both application specific and multipurpose
networks. Appropriate use of the International Standard will enable a controlled migration to generic
cabling. Certain circumstances may warrant the introduction of application specific cabling; these
instances should be minimized.\par

{\bf Task~8.}~~{\it Read the text below and answer the following questions: \par}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How many subsystems does generic cabling contain?
    \item What do distributors provide?
    \item What does the campus backbone cabling subsystem include?
    \item Where does the building backbone cabling subsystem include?
    \item How should all cabling elements at the FT be terminated?
    \item What does the work area cabling do?
    \item What assumptions have been made?
    \item What is a general cabling?
    \item What does the number and type of subsystems depend upon?
\end{enumerate}
\par
The horizontal cabling subsystem extends from FD(s) to the TO(s). The subsystem includes the
horizontal cables, the mechanical termination of the horizontal cables at the FD, the cross-connections
at the FD and the TOs\par
Horizontal cables should be continuous from the FD to the TOs. If necessary, one TP is permitted
between an FD and any TO. The transmission charachteristics of the horizontal cabling shall be
maintained. The incoming and outgoing pairs and fibres at the TP shall be connected so that a 1:1
correspondence is maintained. All cable elements at the TP shall be mechanically terminatrd. The TP
shall not be used as a point of administration (that is, not used as a cross-connect), and application
specific equipment shall not be located there. The TP may only contain passive connecting hardware.\par
The work area cabling connects the TO to the terminal equipment. It is non-permanent and
application specific and therefore lies outside the scope of this International Standard. Assumptions
have been made concerning the length and the transmission performance of the work area cable; these
assumptions are identified when relevant.\par
The generic cabling is a hierarchial star structure which may take the form shown in figure \ref{interrelationship}. The
number and type of subsystems that are included in generic cabling implementation depnds upon the geography and size of
the campus or building, and upon the strategy of the user. For example, in a campus having only one building the 
primary distribution point is the BD, and there is no need for a campus backbone cabling subsystem. On the other hand,
one large building may be treated as a campus, with a campus backbone subsystem and several BDs. Further information on
the application of the cabling structure is given in D.3 of annex D.

\end{figure}

Cables shall be installed between adjacent levels in the structure. This forms a hierarchial star as shown in figure 2,
 and provides the high degree of flexibility needed to accomodate a variety of applications. Annex
D details how to configure various networks within the boundaries of the hierarchial star topology. These topologies are
established by the interconnection of the cable elements at cross-connects, and at the application specific equipment.\par

For some applications, additional direct connections between FDs or DBs are desirable and are permitted. The building
backbone cable may also interconnect FDs. However, such connections shall be in addition to those required for the basic
hierarchial ster topology.\par

TOs are located on the wall, floor, or elsewhere in the work area, depending on the design of the building. The design of 
generic cabling should provide for TOs to be installed in readily accessible locations throughout the usable floor space.\par

A high density of TOs will enhace the flexibility of the cabling to accomodate changes. In many countries two TOs are
provided to serve a maximum of $10m^2$ of usable floor space.\par

TOs may be presented singly, pr in groups, but each work area shall be served by a minimum of two.\par

A minimum of one TO served by 100 $\Omega$ or 120 $\Omega$ cable shall be provided at each work area (100 $\Omega$ preferred).
Other TOs shall be supported by either balanced cable or by fibre optical cable. In the horizontal cabling, at least one
TO shall be configured as specified in item b of balanced or optical fibre cable or at least one TO shall be served by 
either class D or optical class. When a TO is supported by balanced cable, 2 pairs or 4 pairs shall be provided at each TO;
all pairs shall be terminated. If less than four pairs are provided, the outlet shall be clearly marked. Emerging balanced
cable applications may be limited by differential delay of pairs that serve a single telecommunications outlet.\par

{\bf Task~16.}~~{\it Read the text given below. Translate it into Russian. Then ask your neighbour to
translate it from Russian into English sentence after sentence. \par}

There shall be no more then two hierarchial levels of cross-connects in the backbone
cabling to limit signal degradation for passive systems and to simplify administration in keeping
track of cables are connections. No more than one cross-connect shall be passed through to reach
the CD when starting from a FD. \par

A single backbone cabling cross-connect may meet the cross-connect needs of the entire
backbone subsystem. Backbone cabling cross-connects may be located in telecommunications
closets or equipment rooms. See annex D for guidance on accomodating ring, bus, tree, etc.
configurations within the hierarchial star.\par

The star topology is applicable to the cable elements of the transmission medium, such as
individual fibres or pairs. Depending on the physical charachteristics of a site, cable elements that
are terminated at different locations may be part of the same cable over a portion of the distance, or
may use individual cables over the entire distance. Hybrid and multi-unit cables that meet the 
requirements of 8.3 may be used in the backbone cabling subsystem.\par

{\bf Task~17.}~~{\it Read the following text and together with your neighbour, compose a dialogue on its basis. \par}

The performance of a permanent link is specified at and between interfaces to the link. The
permanent link comprises only passive sections of cable and connecting hardware. A transition
point may also be included in the horizontal subsystem. Active and passive application specific
hardware is not addressed by the International Standard.\par

The optical fibre and balanced cable links are connected together using an optical fibre to
balanced cable converter, a cross-connect and two equipment cables. Interfaces to the cabling are at
each end of a permanent link. Interfaces to the cabling are specified at the TO and at any point
where application specific equipment is connected to the cabling; the work area and equipment
cables are not included in the permanent link.\par

Interfaces to the cabling are at each end of a permanent link. Interfaces to the cabling are
specified at the TO and at any point where application specific equipment is connected to the
cabling; the work area and equipment cables are not included in the permanent link.\par

The performance of the channel is specified at and between interfaces to the channel. The
cabling comprises only passive sections of cable connecting hardware, work area cords, equipment
cords and patch cords.\par

The optical fibre and balanced cabling channels are connected together using an optical fibre to
balanced cable converter. There are four channel interfaces; one at each end of the copper channel,
and one at each end of the optical fibre channel. Equipment connections are not considered to be
part of the channel. All work area, equipment cables and patch cords are included in the channel.\par

Consideration should be given, when specifying and designing cabling, to the possible future
connection of cabling subsystems to form longer links and channels. The performance of these
longer links and channels will be lower than that of any of the individual subsystem links and
channels from which they are constructed. Measurement of permanent links and channels should be
made, initially, upon installation of each cabling subsystem. Testing of combined subsystems
should be performed as required by the application.\par
